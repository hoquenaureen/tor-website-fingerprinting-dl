Website fingerprinting (WF) facilitates an eavesdropper to classify the websites even if a user is visiting over an
encrypted or Tor traffic. In this attack, an adversary exploits the content differences among websites that it infers
from the network traffic. If the adversary uses a machine-learning algorithm to classify, it first needs to extract the
features from the traffic that are unique to each site and then trains the classifier. A deep learning technique does not
require any feature extraction or engineering. In this work, we use a few deep learning (DL) models using
convolution neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to perform WF attacks that do not need
any engineered feature sets website classification.
